I am a skilled and experienced game developer and 3D modeler proficient in Blender, Unity, Unreal Engine, C#, C, C++, and Python. I started making games when I was 9 years old and landed my first job in the industry at 16, working for a medium-sized indie game studio. Since then, I have completed various freelance projects on Fiverr. I love working with passionate developers and bringing creative visions to reality. I enjoy problem-solving, especially while programming. I treat every challenge as a fun puzzle to solve. Currently, I create low poly 3D asset collections for the Unreal Marketplace and I am developing a twin-stick shooter game as a hobby.
